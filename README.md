# openevse-wifi-esp8266-ui
A simple html only user interface for the OpenEVSE project based on the ESP8266 and RAPI
This repository contains the source for both the OpenEVSE controller and ESP8266 boards.  This is based off of the development version 4.3.2 from lincomatic/open_evse code and master version of chris1howell/OpenEVSE_RAPI_WIFI_ESP8266
Used development version because it has a nice feature for solar charging and control.  The pilot adjust has the option of not saving to EEPROM.
Added a command to query the delay timer settings via RAPI in development version 4.3.2.  All UI code is done on the ESP8266 side.
Version is left as is with a 'b' attached to it for my modifications.
